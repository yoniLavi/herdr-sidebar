# Herdr Sidebar

### The sidebar your terminal was missing — inspired by VS Code.

A file explorer and a full source-control panel in one dockable
[herdr](https://github.com/ogulcancelik/herdr) pane — activity-bar switching,
mouse-driven controls, AI-drafted commit messages, and file previews that open as editor
tabs — ephemeral until you double-click to pin one.

If you've ever alt-tabbed out of your terminal just to *look* at the tree, the diff, or
what's staged, this closes that loop.

```sh
herdr plugin install alexarthurs/herdr-sidebar/plugins/herdr-sidebar
```

Tagged releases use SHA-256-verified binaries on supported platforms and fall back to a
source build when needed.

## Three Views

The activity bar switches Explorer, Search, and Source Control instantly in one process.
Use the mouse or press `1`, `2`, and `3`.

### Explorer & Preview

<div align="center">
<img src="plugins/herdr-sidebar/docs/media/preview.png" alt="Explorer and file preview" width="920">
</div>

- Navigate a real expandable tree with file icons, hover actions, Git decorations, and
  `m` / Ctrl+right-click context menus.
- Click a file to reuse an ephemeral preview tab; double-click to pin it. Preview in the
  same tab instead by setting **Preview opens in** to `pane` (beside the sidebar) or
  `above` (about 60% of the tab's largest pane that is not the sidebar's own — usually
  your agent, which keeps its full width below, and enough rows to work in). Both keep ONE viewer per tab and share
  it, so switching between them takes effect on the next viewer you open, not on the
  one already up.
- Preview text, Markdown, images, and—when `ffmpeg` is available—video poster frames.
  Read-only previews support mouse selection and clipboard copy.
- Find files with `Ctrl+P`; search project contents with `Ctrl+F` or `Ctrl+Shift+F`.
  Search supports case, whole-word, regex, and include/exclude filters.
- Stage files or folders from the tree without crossing nested-repository boundaries.
- Opt into a terminal editor for mouse clicks, while Enter keeps the built-in preview.
- Press `e` in a text preview for the experimental editor with selection, find,
  clipboard actions, explicit save, and external-change protection.

### Source Control

<div align="center">

</div>

- Stage, unstage, discard, commit, inspect diffs, and sync with the upstream.
- Click the branch name—in the panel header, a repository row, or the Git footer—to
  switch local branches or create a local tracking branch from a remote.
- Use one commit box per repository in multi-repo folders.
- Draft a commit message with the ✧ button through the local `claude` CLI, with a
  filename-based fallback when Claude is unavailable.
- Browse commits, file history, branches, worktrees, remotes, stashes, and tags.
- Keep branch and sync controls visible in every sidebar view with the compact Git footer;
  hide it from Settings if you prefer the extra row.

## Settings

<div align="center">
<img src="plugins/herdr-sidebar/docs/media/settings.png" alt="Sidebar settings" width="920">
</div>

Settings persist across tabs and restarts. Configure:

- Unified or separate Explorer and Source Control panes
- Left/right docking and preferred width
- Material/emoji icons and VS Code/light/terminal colors
- Tab/pane/above preview placement and optional custom editor
- Hidden files, Git decorations, Git footer, and footer hotkeys
- Auto-open, strict open/close toggle, focus-on-open, and live folder following

The sidebar follows a neighbouring pane's working directory by default. A manually chosen
folder stays put until that pane changes directory again.

## Keys

| Explorer / Search | Action | Source Control | Action |
|---|---|---|---|
| `↑↓` / `jk` | move | `Enter` | stage / unstage |
| `←→` / `hl` | fold / unfold | `a` / `u` | stage all / none |
| `Enter` | toggle / preview | `c` | commit message |
| `Ctrl+P` | quick open | `A` | draft message |
| `Ctrl+F` | content search | `S` | sync |
| `.` | hidden files | `o` | open diff |
| `r` | refresh | `r` | refresh |
| `m` | context menu | `m` | context menu |
| `s` | settings | `s` | settings |
| `b` | hide | `b` | hide |
| `1` / `2` / `3` | change view | `1` / `2` / `3` | change view |

Preview: drag to select, `Ctrl/Cmd+C` to copy, arrows/PageUp/PageDown to scroll,
`w` to toggle wrapping, and `q` or Esc to close.

Host keybindings can invoke the direct `show-explorer`, `show-search`, `show-git`, and
`quick-open` actions. For example, bind `cmd+p` to:

```toml
[[keys.command]]
key = "cmd+p"
type = "shell"
command = "herdr plugin action invoke quick-open --plugin herdr-sidebar"
```

## Install & Develop

**Requirements:** herdr 0.8+. Source builds require Rust 1.89+.
A Nerd Font is recommended for material icons; the emoji theme works everywhere.

```sh
herdr plugin install alexarthurs/herdr-sidebar/plugins/herdr-sidebar
```

Local checkout:

```sh
cd plugins/herdr-sidebar
cargo build --release
herdr plugin link .
```

Open or toggle it:

```sh
herdr plugin action invoke herdr-sidebar.open-sidebar-windows   # Windows
herdr plugin action invoke herdr-sidebar.open-sidebar           # Linux / macOS
```

Useful development actions:

| Action | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `open-sidebar` / `open-sidebar-windows` | open, focus, or hide the sidebar |
| `open-git` / `open-git-windows` | toggle separate Source Control |
| `show-explorer`, `show-search`, `show-git` | open/focus one activity without toggling |
| `quick-open` | open/focus the sidebar and show the file picker |
| `redeploy` / `redeploy-windows` | refresh running sidebars after a rebuild |

Use the `-windows` suffix for each direct action on Windows.

All docking, metadata, pane creation, and preview control use herdr's socket API directly.
The plugin is one Rust crate; optional external tools only enhance Markdown (`glow`), video
posters (`ffmpeg`), and AI commit drafts (`claude`).
